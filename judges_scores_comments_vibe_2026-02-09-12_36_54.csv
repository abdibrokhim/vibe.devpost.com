923142, CivicGuard AI ,Ishu Anand Jaiswal,Innovation / Wow Factor | 30%,4,"Really impressive civic tech project! ""Waze for Infrastructure"" is a perfect analogy. Strong technical execution with React, TypeScript, Supabase real-time, and Leaflet mapping. The gamification angle is smart and could drive actual engagement. Love the attention to real-world challenges like GPS drift. Great storytelling in the presentation too. The real-time sync moment across devices was clearly a breakthrough. Strong potential for municipal adoption."

The dual-layer detection architecture is smart engineering — deterministic guards for speed, semantic auditing for depth. The transparency panel is a standout; users seeing why content got flagged builds real trust. Human-in-the-loop that feeds corrections back into the system is exactly the right approach. Thorough documentation, live demo, video, GitHub, and Canva presentation. This feels production-ready. Only minor note: no vibe coding tools explicitly called out."

Pulling from multiple data sources (Alpha Vantage, Finnhub, news APIs) and grounding responses with ChromaDB is solid engineering. The PDF doc is a nice touch. Curious how it handles conflicting news sources in practice. Live Vercel demo works well."

919732,CVerify,Ishu Anand Jaiswal,Innovation / Wow Factor | 30%,5,Really creative approach using DNS as a trust anchor for credential verification. The crypto is solid - RSA-2048 signing with SHA-256 and DNS-based public key distribution is elegant and avoids blockchain bloat. The 4-portal architecture covers the full workflow well. Documentation is excellent with clear project structure and setup instructions. Unique idea I haven't seen elsewhere.

Good tech stack with RAG, pgvector, FastAPI and React. My concern is the scope feels very ambitious for a hackathon - blockchain audit logs, bias detection, multilingual support etc. Would love to see a focused working demo rather than a broad feature list. The legal access gap is real though, and this has potential."
